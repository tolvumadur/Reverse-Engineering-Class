\noindent\textbf{Grade Policy:} 
Grading in this course will be based on three components: Participation, Projects, and Practical Exams.
Participation is worth 10\% of the final grade. Students are expected to attend class. Any absence more than 2 class periods will result in a 1\% deduction from the 10\% total.
Projects are worth 60\% of the final grade. Fourteen projects will be submitted throughout the semester.
Exams are worth 30\% of the final grade. Exams will be interactive sessions with the instructor evaluating students understanding of course topics and ability to use taught skills.
