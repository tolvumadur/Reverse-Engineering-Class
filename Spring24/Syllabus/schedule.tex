\vskip.15in
Each week, the previous week's assignment will be due on Monday.
By Tuesday's class you will have read that week's textbook chapter (~20 pages).
You will be required to attend class and participate on Tuesdays and Thursdays.

In class, we will send the first 15 minutes on lecture and questions.
The remainder of the class will be a lab section where everyone will work on the week's assignment.
Everyone will be responsible for producing their own lab write-up each week.
But, working together and learning together is encouraged.
You will be responsible to be able to perform the lab techniques yourself on the exams.

You will submit all of your lab write-ups in GitHub, and you will be allowed to have these public to show to potential recruiters your skills.
The format of the reports will be markdown.
The reports will describe what you discovered about the malware we analyze, and how other analysts could reproduce and confirm your findings.
