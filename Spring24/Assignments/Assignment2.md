# Basic Static Analysis Part 2

Create a report like last week, this time for the malware in Lab 1-3 and 1-4.

This week also corresponds to Chapter 2 in the textbook. Make sure you've ironed out any issues in your VM setup and have networking disabled to prepare for next week. Next week in Chapter 3 we will be doing dynamic analysis (that means actually running the malware!)

Turn in a link to your report on Github to get credit for this week's lab.
